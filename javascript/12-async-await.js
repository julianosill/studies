/*	ASYNC AWAIT

	Originally, JavaScript used callback functions to handle asynchronous actions.
	The problem with callbacks is that they encourage complexly nested code which quickly becomes difficult to read, debug, and scale.
	With ES6, JavaScript integrated native promises which allow us to write significantly more readable code.
	ES8 provides a new syntax for handling our asynchronous action, <async...await>.
	The <async...await> syntax allows us to write asynchronous code that reads similarly to traditional synchronous, imperative programs.
