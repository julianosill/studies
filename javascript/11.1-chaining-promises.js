/*	CHAINING MULTIPLE PROMISES

	One common pattern weâ€™ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in a certain order.
	We might make one request to a database and use the data returned to us to make another request and so on.

	Example:
	
		firstPromiseFunction()									Invokes the function and return a promise.
		.then((firstResolveVal) => {							Invokes <.then()> with an anonymous function at the success handler.
			return secondPromiseFunction(firstResolveVal);		Inside of it, returns a new promise: the result of invoking a second function (secondPromiseFunction) with the first promise's resolved value.
		})
		.then((secondResolveVal) => {							Invokes a second <.then()> for the second promise settling.
			console.log(secondResolveVal);						Prints the second promise's resolved value.
		});

	In order for our chain to work properly, we had to return the promise secondPromiseFunction(firstResolveVal).
	This ensured that the return value of the first <.then()> was our second promise rather than the default return of a new promise with the same settled value as the initial.

	// Example 1:

	// Generates a random number to serve as delay in a setTimeout() since real asynchrnous operations take variable amounts of time.
	function generateRandomDelay() {
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * 2000);
	}

	// Generates a random number to serve as a "tracking number" on the shipping label. In real life this wouldn't be a random number.
	function generateTrackingNumber() {
		return Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000);
	}
